# RMUAST
Repository for RMUAST F17. Course taught at SDU.

This repository holds all the material created during the course of RMAUST-U1. 

Weekly excercises are sorted by folder structure, by modules. 
Each module folder holds the latex code, compiled PDF and the source code for that given weeks exercises.

The final report will have it's folder of its own, but include all compiled module exercise PDF's in the appendix.
